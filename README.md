# CUDA-NVIDIA_Learning
Programming Massively Parallel Processors with CUDA-NVIDIA
 - Run with command (to compile codes): 
```
nvcc [all of *.cu] -o [name_file_output] -I/usr/include/opencv4 -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_videoio
```

 - Using nvprof tool: 
```
sudo /usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/nvprof --metrics all ./[name_file_output]
```
 - On target before debugging: 
```
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/nvhost-dbg-gpu
```
  - check its L4T info "JetPack never installs to the Jetson. Only L4T or packages, so there isnâ€™t any JetPack version associated with the Jetson other than possibly the install GUI front end was JetPack of a certain version. On the other hand, so far as I know, there is only one L4T version associated with each JetPack release.":
```
cat /etc/nv_tegra_release
```
